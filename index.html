                    <p>
                         I’m Harshit Pathak, a student currently pursuing my Bachelor’s in Computer Applications (BCA) at Amrapali University, formerly known as the Amrapali Group of Institutes. My academic path has been one of steady growth and determination — completing my 10th grade with 75% during the challenging COVID batch, followed by securing over 90% in my 12th under the Uttarakhand Board (UBSE).
                         From the classroom to the computer lab, I have always valued learning as a continuous process — exploring concepts deeply, asking questions, and connecting theory with real-world applications. This mindset has helped me navigate my education with a focus on both understanding and applying knowledge.
